# Security and Compliance
### 1. Cross-Account S3 Access Needs Both Identity and Resource Policies
For secure cross-account S3 access, configure identity-based policies in the requesting account and resource-based policies in the bucket-owning accounts. This ensures both sides explicitly allow access.
### 2. Cross-Account Role for Secure S3 Access
To securely allow developers (not testers) to access S3 in a production account, create a trusted IAM role in the production account and control access to it using group policies in the development account.
Create a Role in production account, that defines the development account as a trusted entity and specify a permissions policy that allows trusted users to update the bucket. Then, modify the IAM group policy in development account, so that testers are denied access to the newly created role. Developers can use the newly created role to access the live S3 buckets in production environment.
### 3. Custom Headers for S3 Website Access via CloudFront
- To ensure users cannot access content directly via the S3 URL and can only reach it through CloudFront, one effective solution is to:
    - Configure CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the S3 website endpoint.
    - Use custom headers that are required in the request, and configure the S3 bucket policy to only allow access when these headers are present—which only CloudFront adds.
### 4. Gemalto device
- A **Gemalto device** is a **third-party** hardware MFA token, not made by AWS. It can be used with AWS if configured properly, but AWS does **not natively support reusing** it across different AWS accounts or organizations.
- AWS does not support reusing MFA devices like Gemalto tokens from another company; a new MFA setup is required for each AWS account.
- The user should register a new MFA device (hardware or virtual) for their AWS account. This could be: A new virtual MFA app (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or the AWS MFA app), Or a new hardware MFA token (which could be a new Gemalto device or an AWS-supported hardware token).
### 5. Manual File System Resize Required
- When you increase the size of an Amazon EBS volume, AWS updates the block storage, but the file system on the instance doesn't automatically expand to use the extra space. You must manually resize the file system (using commands like resize2fs on Linux or Disk Management on Windows) to match the new volume size.
### 6. CMK Access Must Match the ASG’s Account and Role
- For Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to launch instances with encrypted EBS volumes, always use CMKs from the same AWS account as the ASG and explicitly grant the ASG’s service-linked role access in the CMK's key policy.
- Problem occurs when ASG tries to launch an instance using an EBS volume encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK) that the ASG's service-linked role doesnt have access to—possibly because the CMK was from a different AWS account. The best solution is to:
    - Copy the snapshot of the encrypted EBS volume,
    - Re-encrypt it using a CMK from the same AWS account where the ASG exists,
    - Grant the ASG's service-linked role permission to use that CMK in the key policy.
### 7. AWS Maintains Infrastructure, Customers Manage Their Data
- AWS is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure and platforms like Amazon S3, while customers control data, access, and configuration within those services.
### 8. S3 Access Is Explicit – Even for Root
- S3 bucket policies must explicitly include the AWS root user as a principal if you want them to have access. Being the account root does not bypass the bucket policy.
### 9. Default Encryption for S3
- To enforce encryption for all objects uploaded to an S3 bucket, the most straightforward and effective method is to enable Default Encryption on the bucket. This setting ensures that any uploaded object is automatically encrypted using either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS), even if the upload request does not specify encryption.
### 10. MFA-Delete for S3 Buckets
- MFA-Delete is a security feature on S3 buckets that prevents accidental or malicious deletion of objects. To enable MFA-Delete, you must use the root account credentials, and the setting can only be configured via the AWS CLI or an API call—not from the console. This ensures that only the account owner with MFA can delete versioned objects or change the bucket’s versioning state.
### 11. Parameter Groups for Enforcing SSL in RDS
- A DB parameter group is a collection of settings that control the behavior and configuration of a database engine in Amazon RDS or Aurora.
- In Amazon RDS, database-level settings like enforcing SSL/TLS connections are managed through DB parameter groups. For PostgreSQL, you must set the rds.force_ssl parameter to 1 in the associated DB parameter group to force all connections to use SSL. This ensures encryption in transit. 
- Security groups only control access, not encryption, and RDS doesn't provide a direct “enable SSL” toggle in the console for this enforcement.
### 12. AWS Inspector for Patch Compliance Reporting
- AWS Inspector automatically scans **EC2 instances for known vulnerabilities** and unintended network exposure. It integrates with AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to assess patch compliance by identifying missing security updates and software vulnerabilities. 
- For compliance reporting, Inspector generates findings that can be exported or monitored weekly—making it the right tool for verifying that your patching strategy is effective and that no critical vulnerabilities remain.
### 13. S3 Access Logs for Stealthy Monitoring
- S3 Access Logs provide detailed records for the requests made to your S3 bucket, including request type, requester identity, IP address, and error codes. These logs can be automatically delivered to another S3 bucket. You can then query them using Amazon Athena, allowing you to quietly investigate unauthorized access attempts without alerting the employees. 
- This method is non-intrusive and does not require modifying user permissions or policies, which could raise suspicion.
### 14. AWS Organizations with OU for Scalable Governance
- When a company grows, managing access and resource boundaries within a single AWS account becomes hard and risky. With AWS Organizations, you can create Organizational Units (OUs) to group accounts based on departments (e.g., Billing, Operations, Finance) and apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce security and operational boundaries. 
- This structure offers clear separation between departments, prevents unauthorized resource sharing (like VPC peering), and provides centralized billing and governance.
### 15. Customer Duties in EC2 Under Shared Responsibility 
In EC2, AWS protects the physical servers and network, but you’re responsible for everything inside your instance — like installing updates, configuring firewalls (security groups), and securing your apps. This means you must manage the operating system and software to keep it safe. Knowing where AWS stops and you begin is key to using EC2 securely.
### 16. Secure Viewer Connections with HTTPS When Using S3 Website Endpoint
- When you use an S3 bucket as a website with CloudFront, you can use HTTPS between the user and CloudFront, but not between CloudFront and the S3 website endpoint — that part uses HTTP only. If you want full HTTPS encryption from end to end, use the S3 REST endpoint instead of the website endpoint.
### 17. Use the S3 REST Endpoint Instead of the Website Endpoint
If you want to keep your data encrypted with HTTPS all the way from the user to your S3 bucket, use the S3 REST endpoint (like https://bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com) instead of the S3 website endpoint (like http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com). The website endpoint only supports HTTP between CloudFront and S3, but the REST endpoint supports HTTPS, giving you better security end-to-end.
### 18. Signed URLs and Cookies for Subscriber-Only Content
- To keep your CloudFront content private for subscribers only, use signed URLs when giving access to one file at a time, and signed cookies when allowing access to multiple files at once. Both options make sure that only users with the right token or permission can open the content, which is perfect for membership or paid services.
### 19. Enforce MFA and Enable CloudTrail for IAM Governance
- To protect your AWS account, always turn on MFA (multi-factor authentication) for users with high permissions, and enable CloudTrail to keep a full record of all IAM actions. This helps you prevent unauthorized access and track who did what, which is key for security and auditing.
### 20. SSE-C for Custom Key Management with S3 Encryption
- If you want S3 to encrypt your files but still keep control of your own encryption keys, use SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys). With SSE-C, you give S3 the key each time you upload or download a file, but S3 doesn’t store the key, so it stays fully under your control — useful for strict compliance needs.
### 21. Client-Side Encryption:
- You encrypt the data yourself before uploading it to S3, and decrypt it yourself after downloading. AWS never sees the data unencrypted and doesn’t help with encryption or key management at all.
### 22. Use Root User for CloudFront Key Pairs Only
- Only the root user in your AWS account can create CloudFront key pairs, which are needed to set up signed URLs and cookies for private content. This is done to keep your content extra secure. While you should avoid using the root user for daily tasks, it's still required for important actions like managing CloudFront key pairs.
### 23. Use ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery for Immediate Deletion in Secrets Manager
- When you delete a secret in AWS Secrets Manager, it usually waits 7 to 30 days before it's gone — but if you need to delete it right away and reuse the name, use **ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery**=true in the CLI or SDK. This skips the waiting period and permanently deletes the secret immediately.
### 24. Use SecureString with CloudTrail for Encrypted Secrets and Auditing
- Store secrets in SSM Parameter Store using SecureString, which keeps them encrypted with KMS. Then use CloudTrail to automatically log when someone views or decrypts those secrets. This gives you both secure storage and full tracking, helping meet compliance needs easily.
- Use SSM SecureString when you need basic, encrypted secret storage at low cost. Use Secrets Manager when you need advanced secret features like auto-rotation, fine-grained access, or production-scale management.
### 25. Cross-Account Access to CMKs with Key and IAM Policies
- To let another AWS account use your CMK (KMS key), you must first update the key policy in your account to give that account permission. 
- Then, in the other (target) account, set IAM policies for users or roles to actually use the key. This setup makes sure that only the right people in the right account can access the key securely.
### 26. KMS CMK Deletion is Reversible Within the Waiting Period
- When you schedule a KMS key (CMK) for deletion, AWS gives you 7 to 30 days before it’s gone forever. During that time, you can cancel the deletion and get the key back. If you delete it by mistake, act fast — because once the waiting period ends, the key is gone permanently, and any data encrypted with it may be lost for good.
### 27. IAM Explicit Deny for Absolute Permission Blocking
- In AWS IAM, if a policy has an explicit "Deny", it will always override any "Allow" — no matter what other permissions are given. This makes it a powerful tool for strictly blocking access to certain actions or resources, even if other policies try to allow them. Use it when you want to make sure something is completely off-limits.
### 28. Object Lock Retention is Version-Specific and Explicit Settings Take Priority
- In S3, each version of an object can have its own lock and retention settings, like how long it can’t be deleted. If you set a retention directly on a version, it overrides the bucket’s default rule. This gives you tight control over compliance and protection for each object version.
- When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version
### 29. SSE-S3 for Simple Server-Side Encryption Without Key Management
- Use SSE-S3 when you want Amazon S3 to encrypt your files automatically using strong AES-256 encryption, and you don’t want to manage any keys yourself. It’s the easiest option for keeping data safe at rest while still meeting basic security and compliance requirements.
### 30. Network Rules for Public Load Balancer Access
- If you're using a public (internet-facing) Load Balancer, make sure the security group and network ACLs allow traffic like HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443) from the internet. If these rules block the ports or IP addresses, your Load Balancer won't be reachable. This is a common reason why users can’t access your app.
### 31. Key Pairs for Secure EC2 SSH Access
- To connect to an EC2 instance using SSH, you need a key pair — a public key (stored on the instance) and a private key (kept by you). This is safer than using passwords and is the recommended way to log in. Make sure to keep your private key safe and never upload it to the server.
