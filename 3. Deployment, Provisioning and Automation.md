# Deployment, Provisioning and Automation
### 1. Checking and fixing whether S3 bucket logging
- The best solution for automatically checking and fixing whether S3 bucket logging is enabled is to use AWS Config rules. AWS Config can:
    - Continuously monitor the logging status of all S3 buckets (including newly created ones).
    - Automatically trigger a remediation action (like enabling logging) if a bucket is non-compliant.
    - This gives you both auditing and automated correction, which is exactly what the company needs.

### 2. Know X-Ray’s Limits – ALBs Aren’t Supported
- AWS X-Ray integrates with many services but not Application Load Balancers. This means you won’t get trace data from ALBs, so if tracing across all layers is critical, consider using API Gateway or NLB instead.
- While AWS X-Ray can trace many services like API Gateway, Lambda, and EC2, it does not support Application Load Balancers (ALB). ALBs do not send trace data to X-Ray, meaning you cannot see what’s happening inside the ALB or trace requests through it using X-Ray. This is a key limitation teams should remember when designing observability for systems using ALBs.

### 3. Always Grant KMS Permissions to ASG Service Roles
- When using encrypted EBS volumes with customer-managed KMS keys, ensure the Auto Scaling service-linked role has the necessary KMS permissions (kms:Decrypt, kms:GenerateDataKey, etc.). Without it, your instances may fail to launch with vague errors like “Client error on launch.”
- The error Client.InternalError: Client error on launch can happen when the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) tries to launch an EC2 instance with an EBS volume encrypted using a customer-managed CMK (KMS key), but the service-linked role for Auto Scaling doesn't have permission to use that key. Since the role can't decrypt or attach the volume, the instance launch fails.

### 4. Some Trusted Advisor Warnings Are Safe to Ignore for Managed Services
- The message "Security Groups - Unrestricted Access" means that the security group allows open access (like 0.0.0.0/0), which normally is a security risk. But in this case, the security group was automatically created by AWS Directory Service, and this level of access is required for the service to function correctly. Therefore, it’s safe to ignore or suppress this Trusted Advisor red flag for this specific case.
- When AWS automatically creates resources like security groups for services (e.g., Directory Service), they might look insecure but are intentionally configured that way. In such cases, it’s acceptable — and sometimes necessary — to suppress the alert after reviewing the context.
- AWS Directory Service lets you run or connect to Active Directory on AWS easily. It helps manage users, devices, permissions, and authentication for applications that need directory-based access — especially helpful for Windows-heavy environments.

### 5. Use CloudWatch Synthetics Canaries to Run and Monitor Scripts
- To run custom scripts regularly for monitoring endpoints and APIs, and to track the results in CloudWatch, the best tool is CloudWatch Synthetics. This service lets you create canaries — small scripts that run on a schedule (like every day), perform actions (like calling your APIs), and automatically report success, failure, response time, and other metrics back to CloudWatch.
- Synthetic monitoring refers to simulating user behavior by running scripted tests at regular intervals to check if an application or endpoint is working as expected — without waiting for a real user to report a problem.

### 6. EC2 Status Checks Are Mandatory and Always On
- You cannot turn off or remove EC2 status checks. They're essential health checks that AWS runs automatically to ensure your instance is functioning correctly at both the hardware and software level.
- Amazon EC2 status checks are built-in system features that automatically monitor the health of an instance. There are two types: System Status Checks (AWS hardware/network) and Instance Status Checks (OS/software inside the instance). These checks cannot be disabled or deleted — they are always active to ensure AWS can detect when something goes wrong with an instance.

### 7. Avoid Hardcoded IAM Names in CloudFormation
- If IAM roles, policies, or users are given fixed names in a CloudFormation template, you risk naming conflicts across stacks or regions. To prevent this, use dynamic naming (like using !Ref, !Sub, or unique suffixes) to ensure every resource name is unique.
- The CloudFormation template might include custom-named IAM resources (like roles or policies with hardcoded names). These names must be globally unique, and if the same template is used in different regions or accounts, the stack might fail to create those resources if they already exist — causing inconsistent stack creation (some resources missing, others working).

### 8. Use Blue/Green deployments to safely reuse RDS DBs across environments
- When you need to keep your database running while testing or creating new Elastic Beanstalk environments, Blue/Green lets you reuse the DB without recreating or terminating anything, ensuring zero downtime and full control.

### 9. Use CloudFront Invalidation for Immediate File Removal
To quickly pull a file from the CloudFront cache — especially when it has bugs or sensitive data — **run an invalidation request** (you must invalidate it), which forces CloudFront to remove the file right away from all edge locations.

### 10. Use AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue for EC2 Recovery
- To automatically recover a broken (impaired) EC2 instance using AWS Systems Manager, you should use the `AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue` automation document. This tool helps fix common issues like misconfigured networking, boot errors, or lost admin passwords without manual intervention, and it’s the official AWS way to recover impaired instances.

### 11. Use !GetAtt to fetch resource attributes like the RDS endpoint 
— !GetAtt is the correct intrinsic function when you need details beyond just the resource name or ID.
- To get the connection endpoint of an RDS database in a CloudFormation template, you use the !GetAtt (Get Attribute) function. It retrieves specific details about a resource, like the Endpoint.Address of an RDS instance, which is exactly what you need for connecting your EC2 to the database.

### 12. AMI sharing
- You can only share AMIs that have unencrypted volumes and volumes that are encrypted with a customer-managed CMK. You cannot share AMIs that are encrypted with AWS-managed CMKs, only your own CMKs (customer-managed) or unencrypted volumes can be shared. This is a key limitation for cross-account or cross-region AMI sharing.
- You do not need to share the Amazon EBS snapshots that an AMI references in order to share the AMI. When you share an AMI, AWS automatically takes care of linking it to its snapshots, so you don’t need to manually share the snapshots.

### 13. Use AWS Patch Manager for Fast, Automated Patching
- When EC2 instances need patching quickly and consistently, Patch Manager is the best tool — it uses tags, schedules, and patch baselines to keep your fleet secure and compliant with minimal effort.
- The fastest and most efficient way to fix patching issues on AWS EC2 instances is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager. It automates the process of finding missing patches and applying them to all tagged and managed instances, following your patch compliance rules — no manual effort needed.

### 14. AMI Choice for Preinstalled Software
- Always use an AMI that already includes all required software (e.g., CloudWatch agent) when setting up EC2 Auto Scaling Groups. This ensures consistency and avoids missing components across instances in different ASGs.

### 15. Stack Policies for CloudFormation Protection
- Use Stack Policies in AWS CloudFormation to prevent accidental updates or deletions of sensitive resources. This ensures critical infrastructure remains safe during updates—even if someone makes a mistake in the template or during a deployment.
- A Stack Policy acts like a resource-level permission guardrail during stack updates. It lets you specify which resources should be protected and can only be updated if the policy allows it, preventing accidental loss or modification due to human error.

### 16. Trusted Advisor for Service Limits Monitoring
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor with CloudWatch Events to monitor service limits like Kinesis shard usage. This combo lets you automatically detect when you're approaching service quotas and respond before performance issues occur.
- To monitor when Kinesis Data Streams is approaching its shard limit, Trusted Advisor provides service limit checks, including for Kinesis shard usage. You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events (now called EventBridge) to monitor these checks and trigger notifications (e.g., via SNS) when limits are near. This solution is proactive, automated, and designed exactly for monitoring AWS resource limits.

### 17. Resource Import for CloudFormation Migration
- Use the resource import feature to bring existing AWS resources under CloudFormation control. This allows teams to transition to full infrastructure-as-code without deleting or recreating resources, enabling safe and consistent cloud management.
- When AWS resources are created manually (outside CloudFormation), but you later want to manage them with CloudFormation, the correct approach is to use resource import. This lets you associate existing AWS resources with a CloudFormation stack without needing to recreate them. It’s especially useful for migrating infrastructure into infrastructure-as-code management while preserving the live resource state.

### 18. Use .ebextensions to Control Beanstalk Auto Scaling
- In Elastic Beanstalk, use configuration files (like .ebextensions) to set the ASG health check type to ELB. This enables Beanstalk to replace EC2 instances based on actual ELB health status, improving reliability and automating fault recovery.
- In Elastic Beanstalk, the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is managed by Beanstalk itself. To ensure that unhealthy instances are replaced based on Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) health checks—which are more accurate at detecting actual user-facing failures—you must configure the ASG to use ELB health checks. However, since Beanstalk controls the ASG, you can’t change this directly in the EC2 console. Instead, you must define this setting in the .ebextensions configuration file within your Beanstalk environment.

### 19. Change Set Execution Deletes Others
- A Change Set is a preview of the changes that AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack when you update it. Instead of updating your stack right away, you first create a change set, which shows you: What resources will be added, What resources will be modified and What resources will be deleted. This lets you review and confirm the changes before they are applied, helping to avoid mistakes.
- In AWS CloudFormation, once you execute a change set on a stack, all other change sets for that same stack are automatically deleted by CloudFormation. This is expected behavior to avoid conflicts or outdated changes being applied. That’s why the teams notice all their change sets had been lost—they executed one, and the rest were removed by AWS.

### 20. StackSets with Organizations for Cross-Account IAM
- AWS CloudFormation StackSets allow you to deploy the same CloudFormation template (such as one that creates IAM roles) across multiple AWS accounts and regions in a controlled, automated way. When used with AWS Organizations, StackSets can push IAM roles to all member accounts automatically, ensuring consistent permissions and eliminating manual errors.
- This is the best solution for large organizations with many AWS accounts that need centralized, repeatable IAM configurations.

### 21. Use CloudWatch Events for Scheduled EBS Backups
- Amazon CloudWatch Events allows you to schedule automated EBS snapshots reliably, ensuring critical data is regularly backed up. It’s the simplest and most efficient method for scheduled snapshot automation.
- To ensure EBS snapshots are taken automatically and regularly (every few minutes, as required), Amazon CloudWatch Events (now part of EventBridge) can be used to trigger snapshot creation on a schedule. This is a reliable and scalable way to automate snapshots without manual intervention. You can set up a rule to trigger either a Lambda function or an AWS Systems Manager Automation document that performs the snapshot.

### 22. Resizing EC2 EBS-backed Instances
- To resize an EC2 instance, it must be EBS-backed, stopped before resizing, and handled carefully in Auto Scaling groups to avoid unintended replacement.
- Only EBS-backed instances support resizing while preserving data. Instance store-backed instances lose their data on stop/terminate, so resizing isn’t supported.
- To change an instance type, you must stop the EC2 instance first. This ensures that AWS can reassign it to new hardware.
- Auto Scaling caution: When an instance in an ASG is stopped for resizing, the ASG may consider it unhealthy and replace it unless you detach it from the group or suspend health checks.

### 23. Systems Manager Inventory for Compliance and Metadata Collection
- AWS Systems Manager Inventory is the best fit for collecting metadata about your EC2 and on-premises instances. It automatically gathers details such as installed applications, network configurations, and instance properties. 
- This data helps organizations validate what is running on each instance and ensure compliance with internal software policies across both cloud and hybrid environments.

### 24. ASG Rebalance Behavior with Terminate Suspended
- When the Terminate process is suspended in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), the ASG can still launch new instances as part of a rebalance activity, but it cannot terminate the old ones. 
- As a result, the ASG temporarily increases its capacity—by up to 10% beyond the desired size—until the rebalance completes. Since termination is disabled, old instances are not removed, causing the ASG to retain the extra instances until the process is manually resumed or adjusted.

### 25. Preparing AWS Infrastructure for Sudden Traffic Spikes
- When you're expecting a massive spike in traffic—like a 10x increase—you need to ensure that your EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG) has enough capacity to launch the necessary number of instances. AWS enforces default limits on the number of instances you can run, so a support request is needed to raise these limits ahead of time. 
- Additionally, Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) are designed to scale gradually, but a sudden surge in traffic can overwhelm them. Pre-warming the ELB through a support request ensures it can handle the initial burst of traffic without delay or errors.

### 26. Improving Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Speed
- Use Blue/Green deployment for zero-downtime upgrades and Golden AMIs to avoid repetitive installation of dependencies, ensuring faster, safer, and more efficient application deployments in Elastic Beanstalk.
- Golden AMI—a pre-baked Amazon Machine Image with your application and dependencies already installed—speeds up the environment creation and deployment process dramatically, because the EC2 instances don’t need to download and install all dependencies every time.

### 27. CloudFormation DeletionPolicy for Safe Backups
- Use DeletionPolicy: Snapshot in CloudFormation templates for EBS volumes when you need automatic backups during stack deletion, ensuring important data is preserved for auditing, compliance, or recovery.

### 28. AMI IDs for Region-Specific Compliance
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs are unique to each AWS region. Even if two AMIs have the same name or content, their IDs will be different in eu-west-1 and us-east-1.
- Compliance scripts help you make sure your cloud setup is safe, correct, and follows your company’s rules—like a checklist that runs automatically.
- Always map and validate AMI IDs per AWS region when designing compliance scripts or automation. AMIs are region-specific, so any validation logic must dynamically adapt or be configured with region-appropriate values to avoid false non-compliance.

### 29. WaitCondition for Stack Synchronization
- cfn-init is a helper tool that runs inside an EC2 instance to set up software and configuration as defined in a CloudFormation template.
- cfn-signal is a tool that sends a success or failure signal from an instance back to CloudFormation to show if setup tasks finished correctly.
- WaitCondition is a CloudFormation resource that tells the stack to pause until it receives a success or failure signal before moving on.
- when you use cfn-init to configure your instance and cfn-signal to notify CloudFormation of success or failure, you must pair it with a Wait Condition. This tells CloudFormation to pause the stack deployment and wait for the signal. If there’s no WaitCondition, CloudFormation proceeds as if everything went fine—even if cfn-init is still running. That’s why your stack shows success prematurely.

### 30. Aurora Reader Endpoint for Seamless Read Scaling
- Amazon Aurora Reader Endpoint is a special endpoint that automatically distributes read-only traffic across all available replicas in an Aurora cluster to improve performance and scalability.
- When scaling events add or remove Aurora read replicas, this endpoint remains unchanged. If you hardcode a specific replica endpoint in your SSM Parameter Store, it becomes outdated when that instance is removed during autoscaling. Using the Reader Endpoint ensures your application always connects to valid, available replicas without manual updates.

### 31. NAT Gateway for Internet Access from Private Subnets
- Use a NAT Gateway to allow EC2 instances in private subnets to access the internet for patching and AWS Systems Manager updates. This approach maintains security by keeping the instances private while still enabling outbound traffic.
- An Internet Gateway is for public subnets. EC2 instances in private subnets cannot use it directly; they must go through a NAT Gateway.

### 32. OpsWorks for Cross-Environment Configuration with Puppet
- AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that supports Chef and Puppet, making it suitable for automating server configurations across both cloud and on-premises environments.
- AWS OpsWorks is ideal when you need to manage both AWS and on-premises resources using Puppet or Chef, especially in regulated industries like healthcare. It helps maintain consistent configurations and simplifies compliance by providing centralized automation across hybrid environments.

### 33. ELB Access Logs for Troubleshooting HTTP Requests
- When EC2 instances are terminated, their logs may no longer be accessible, especially if not forwarded to persistent storage. If the application is behind a Load Balancer (ELB), and HTTP errors are involved, ELB access logs are the best source to trace which requests caused the issues. These logs can be stored in S3 and queried with Amazon Athena, allowing you to investigate 4XX errors without needing access to the terminated instances.

### 34. AMI Sharing Across Accounts
- To share an AMI with other AWS accounts in the same organization, you simply need to modify the AMI's permissions by adding the target account IDs to the launch permissions.
- This can be done through the AMI Console UI or the CLI. Once added, those accounts can see and use the AMI directly to launch instances. No IAM roles or extra steps are needed for this straightforward use case.

### 35. EC2 Burstable Instances for Scalability
- An EC2 burst credit is like stored power that lets certain EC2 instances (like t2 or t3) go faster when they need to do more work. These instances earn credits over time when they’re not using full CPU. When they need to do heavy tasks, they use those credits to temporarily boost their speed.
- T2.micro instances rely on CPU credits to handle workloads. When your site has low traffic, they work fine. But with higher traffic, the CPU usage increases, and the instance runs out of burst credits, leading to CPU throttling, which means very poor performance. To fix this:
    - Switching to a more stable instance type like T2.large or m4.large gives you better baseline performance.
    - Enabling T2 Unlimited allows instances to go beyond the burst credit limits (with an additional cost) to handle spikes without being throttled.

### 36. AMI Deregistration Behavior
- Deregistering an AMI means you can no longer launch new instances from it, whether it's in the original account or in a shared one.
- But running instances based on that AMI remain unaffected, because they already have a complete copy of the root volume created from that AMI.

### 37. Patch Manager for Automated EC2 Updates
- Patch Manager is the go-to AWS Systems Manager feature for automatically handling patches and updates across large groups of EC2 instances. It ensures compliance, reduces manual work, and keeps environments secure and consistent.

### 38. Systems Manager Patch Manager for Emergency Patching
- AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is the right tool to quickly and automatically apply critical patches across all your EC2 instances. It works for both Windows and Linux and can target specific instance groups, define patch baselines, and automate patch application without manual login.

### 39. CloudFormation Signals & Network Reachability
- CloudFormation waits for a signal from the EC2 instance via cfn-signal to confirm success. If the instance is in a private subnet without internet or NAT Gateway access, it can't reach CloudFormation endpoints to send the signal. Also, if cfn-signal runs too late—after the wait condition timeout—CloudFormation marks the deployment as failed, even if it eventually succeeds.

### 40. Launch process and ASG
- A **launch process** is the part of an Auto Scaling Group that handles starting new EC2 instances when scaling out is needed.
- An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) can only scale out if both the Launch process is active and the group has not yet hit its max size. If the Launch process is suspended, the ASG won’t create new instances even when scaling policies are triggered. Also, if the ASG has already reached its maximum size limit (in this case 10), it cannot scale out any further regardless of high CPU usage.

### 41. Load Balancer Queue Scaling
- The SpilloverCount metric in an Application Load Balancer (ALB) indicates how many requests were rejected because the maximum number of queued requests (MaxQueueLength) was exceeded. This is often caused by backend targets (like EC2s in an ASG) being overwhelmed.
- To proactively avoid reaching the SpilloverCount threshold, monitor SurgeQueueLength—it shows how many requests are currently queued. By scaling the ASG when this queue starts growing, you prevent overloading and reduce the risk of request loss.

### 42. CloudFormation Debugging
- When a CloudFormation stack fails during creation, it automatically rolls back by default—this means the EC2 instance (and its logs) are deleted immediately, making it hard to troubleshoot issues like those in cfn-init.
- Setting OnFailure=DO_NOTHING tells CloudFormation not to delete resources when a failure happens. This allows you to log into the EC2 instance, inspect /var/cfn/cfn-init-output.log, and figure out what went wrong, even 24+ hours later if needed.

### 43. Spot Interruption Behaviors for Capacity Management
- AWS allows only stop, hibernate, and terminate as valid interruption behaviors for Spot Instances. These help AWS quickly reclaim capacity, while reboot is not allowed because it doesn't release compute resources.
- rebooting does not free up the instance slot — and Spot capacity must be reclaimed immediately.

### 44. CloudWatch Alarms for Auto Recovery and Restart
- Use CloudWatch alarms with detailed monitoring to trigger native EC2 actions like reboot, stop, or recover. It’s efficient, cost-effective, and minimizes downtime without requiring external automation like Lambda or scripts.
- CloudWatch allows setting alarms on EC2 instance metrics like CPUUtilization.
- Detailed monitoring (1-minute intervals) is necessary for timely detection and action.
- You can configure an EC2 action directly in the alarm to restart the instance when the threshold (e.g., CPU ≥ 90%) is met.

### 45. CloudFormation Parameters for Static Inputs
- The Parameters section is used to collect input values at the time of stack creation and cannot include conditional logic. For any dynamic or conditional behavior in a CloudFormation template, use the Conditions section alongside Resources or Outputs instead.
- In AWS CloudFormation, conditions can be used to control whether certain resources are created or certain outputs are returned. These conditions are typically applied in the Resources, Outputs, and even within the Conditions section itself to drive logic. However, the Parameters section does not support the use of conditions.

### 46. Trust Policies for Controlling Who Can Assume IAM Roles
- IAM supports only one type of resource-based policy: the trust policy, which is used to specify who is allowed to assume a role. This is critical for cross-account access, federated identity, and service role delegation in AWS.

### 47. Use AMI + Elastic IP for Migrating Instance Store–Backed EC2
- Instance store–backed EC2 instances use ephemeral storage that is physically attached to the host and does not persist after the instance is stopped.
- To change their instance type(or resize), you must reate an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the running instance. You can then launch a new EC2 instance using this AMI and select the desired instance type.
- For continuity in network access, if an Elastic IP was associated with the old instance, you can detach it and reassign it to the new one. This ensures minimal disruption to application access despite the underlying infrastructure change.

### 48. Use !ImportValue to Reuse Outputs Across CloudFormation Stacks
- When designing modular CloudFormation templates, use !ImportValue to pull exported values like VPC IDs, Subnet IDs, or IAM Role ARNs from other stacks, allowing for better separation of concerns and infrastructure reusability.

### 49. Use Termination Protection to Safeguard Critical Stacks
- When AWS CloudFormation stack termination protection is enabled, any attempt to delete that stack will silently fail without producing an error or modifying the stack’s status. This protection feature is designed to prevent accidental deletion of critical infrastructure stacks. Because the deletion is blocked at a control level (not a permission or dependency issue), CloudFormation doesn’t raise an error — it simply skips the delete operation.

### 50. Use EC2 Dedicated Hosts for Hardware-Level Control
- Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts provide physical servers fully dedicated to a single customer, allowing more visibility and control over how instances are placed on a server. This is essential when compliance regulations require physical isolation or use of proprietary software tied to specific hardware attributes like sockets, cores, or physical server IDs. 
- Dedicated Hosts support socket-level configurations and licensing requirements for software such as Microsoft or Oracle, making them ideal for organizations migrating from on-premises setups that rely on traditional server licensing and configurations. This option ensures regulatory compliance while maintaining AWS infrastructure flexibility.
- Dedicated Instances run on dedicated hardware but don’t allow visibility into host-level configurations like socket/core mappings—only Dedicated Hosts provide that level of detail.

### 51. Use Automation for S3 Public Access Errors
- When a public S3 bucket unexpectedly returns a 403 Access Denied error, it can be tricky to figure out the root cause. The bucket may appear publicly accessible due to bucket policies, but access can still be blocked by other settings like the S3 Block Public Access feature or an organization's SCP. To systematically troubleshoot this, AWS provides a Systems Manager automation document called AWSSupport-TroubleshootS3PublicRead. 
- This tool checks for common misconfigurations, such as blocked public access settings, missing object-level permissions, or misaligned bucket policies. It's the most efficient and guided way to diagnose and resolve public-read issues for S3.
- Instead of guessing the cause of 403 Access Denied on public S3 buckets, use AWS Systems Manager’s automation document to analyze permissions, policies, and account settings in one go. This ensures a quicker and more reliable resolution.

### 52. Use 'aws:kms' for SSE-KMS Encryption in S3 Requests
- When you upload a file to S3 and want AWS to encrypt it using your KMS key, you must add this to your request header:
x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms.
This tells S3 to use SSE-KMS encryption to protect your data with AWS Key Management Service.

### 53. Stack Policies Protect Resources During Updates Only
- Stack policies are used to stop CloudFormation from changing certain resources during an update — like protecting a live database from being replaced by mistake. They do not control who can access AWS; for that, you must use IAM policies. So, use stack policies to protect resources during updates, and IAM policies to control who can do what.

### 54. Use Export and Fn::ImportValue to Share Resources Between Stacks
- To pass values between independently deployed CloudFormation stacks, define an output with an Export name in the source stack, and reference it in the target stack using Fn::ImportValue. This is the correct and scalable method for cross-stack communication in AWS.

### 55. Use X-Forwarded-For to Capture Client IP Behind ALB
- When your app is behind an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), the client's real IP address doesn’t show up directly — instead, it’s added to the X-Forwarded-For header. Your app should read this header to get the actual IP of the user. This is important for logging, security checks, and knowing who is using your app.

### 56. Use Blue/Green Deployment for Safe, Low-Risk Releases
- Blue/Green deployment in Elastic Beanstalk lets you run your new app version separately from the current one, so you can test it safely before switching live traffic. If something goes wrong, you can quickly switch back with almost no downtime. It’s perfect for production apps where you need high uptime and quick rollback.

### 57. CloudFormation for Automated Network Management
- Use CloudFormation to automate the creation, update, and duplication of network infrastructure across multiple environments. It supports version control and makes network deployments consistent and repeatable.
- AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that lets you define and provision your entire network infrastructure (VPCs, subnets, route tables, gateways, etc.) in reusable, version-controlled templates.
- AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that lets you define and provision your entire network infrastructure (VPCs, subnets, route tables, gateways, etc.) in reusable, version-controlled templates.

    - The bucket is configured to allow public read access (AccessControl: PublicRead).
    - It sets up website hosting with index.html as the main page and error.html for errors.
    - The DeletionPolicy: Retain ensures the bucket isn’t deleted when the stack is deleted.
- Attaches a bucket policy:
    - Grants public read access (s3:GetObject) to all objects in the bucket (Principal: '*' allows access to everyone)
- Outputs:
    - The Outputs section includes the WebsiteURL and S3BucketSecureURL, which CloudFormation will display after stack creation.

### 59. Cloudformation Service-managed permissions:
- AWS automatically handles the creation of IAM roles in administrator and target accounts, making it easier for centralized administration (this is often used in AWS Organizations setups).
- Trust relationship: Whether you're using self-managed or service-managed permissions, the administrator account must be able to assume a role in each target account — this requires setting up the trust relationship between the accounts.
- You must set up a trust relationship between the administrator and target accounts before creating stacks in target accounts.

### 60. CloudFormation StackSets 
- CloudFormation StackSets let you deploy the same CloudFormation template (infrastructure as code) to multiple AWS accounts and regions at once. This is useful for setting up consistent resources (like IAM roles, VPCs, or S3 buckets) across a multi-account or multi-region environment.
- 👉 Example: Create a VPC in all accounts in your AWS Organization with one StackSet, instead of repeating the setup manually.

### 60. StackSets Permission Models in CloudFormation
- AWS CloudFormation StackSets support service-managed and self-managed permission models. Service-managed permissions simplify setup using AWS Organizations and automatic role management, while self-managed requires manual IAM role creation and trust setup between administrator and target accounts.

### 61. AWS Systems Manager 
- AWS Systems Manager lets you manage and automate tasks across both AWS resources (like EC2) and on-premises servers, even in hybrid environments. It supports custom Linux OSes like Raspbian, so you can use it to patch, monitor, and run commands on Raspberry Pi devices alongside your cloud infrastructure.
- 👉 It’s a single interface for managing all your servers—whether they’re in AWS, in your data center, or running on small devices.

### 62. AWS Artifact 
- AWS Artifact is your audit and compliance portal in AWS that gives you on-demand access to:
    - Compliance reports (like ISO, SOC, PCI).
    - Security certifications and audit documents.
    - Legal agreements like the Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for HIPAA.
- You can download these reports directly from AWS Artifact anytime, without needing to contact AWS Support. Perfect for internal and external audits.

### 63. Stack Policies for Controlled Updates
- CloudFormation stack policies protect critical resources (like databases) from accidental changes during updates. For example, you can deny updates to MyDatabase while allowing updates to all other resources using Deny or NotResource. This ensures sensitive resources stay safe, but the rest of the stack can still be updated.
- Deny blocks updates to a specific resource, ensuring it cannot be changed during stack updates.
```
{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "LogicalResourceId/MyDatabase"
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
- NotResource allows updates to everything except the specified resource, effectively protecting it by exclusion.
```
{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "NotResource" : "LogicalResourceId/MyDatabase"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 64. iam:PassRole
- The iam:PassRole permission controls which IAM roles a user can attach to AWS resources (like EC2, Lambda, or ECS) when launching them. Always restrict it to specific roles to prevent users from passing high-privilege roles and causing privilege escalation.
```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "iam:PassRole",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EC2ReadOnlyRole"
}
```
- This means the user can only pass the EC2ReadOnlyRole to EC2 and cannot attach admin-level roles, preventing privilege escalation.
```
{
  "Action": "iam:PassRole",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```
- It means the user can pass ANY IAM role in the account to services like EC2, Lambda, or RDS.
- ⚠️ Risk: If they can also launch resources (e.g., EC2) or create Lambda functions, they could attach high-privilege roles (like Admin roles) and gain full access, leading to privilege escalation.
```
{
  "Action": "iam:PassRole",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:iam:::role/RDS-*"
}
```
- It means the user can pass only IAM role with a name that starts with RDS- in the account to services like EC2, Lambda, or RDS.

### 65. Enforce EFS Encryption with IAM Conditions and SCPs
- To make sure all new EFS file systems are encrypted at rest:
    - Use elasticfilesystem:Encrypted in IAM policies to enforce encryption when users create EFS resources.
    - Apply a Service Control Policy (SCP) at the AWS Organization level to block unencrypted EFS creation across all accounts.

### 66.  Kernel Configurations 
- A kernel configuration refers to the settings and modules in the operating system’s core (kernel) that control how it works with hardware and virtualization. PV AMIs need certain kernel modules to run, but these modules aren’t available in all AWS data centers.

### 67. Paravirtual (PV) AMIs
- Paravirtual AMIs are an older virtualization type in AWS that depend on the host’s kernel for some functions like storage and networking. They require special kernel configurations on the host machine to work, which limits their support in some AWS regions.

### 68. PV AMIs Have Limited Region Support (In Simple Terms)
- Paravirtual (PV) AMIs depend on specific kernel configurations that aren’t available in all AWS regions, so copying them to some regions will fail.
- Instead, use HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) AMIs, which are fully supported across all regions and don’t rely on special kernel modules.
- Always choose HVM AMIs for better compatibility and cross-region portability.
