# Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation
### 1. Use NetworkIn and NetworkOut to Track EC2 Bandwidth Usage
- When analyzing network usage in EC2, always check the CloudWatch metrics NetworkIn and NetworkOut. These show how much data your instances are sending and receiving, helping you identify the most active ones.
- NetworkIn - The number of bytes received by the instance on all network interfaces. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to a single instance.
- NetworkOut - The number of bytes sent out by the instance on all network interfaces. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from a single instance.

### 2. Use IAM Roles for Secure CloudWatch Monitoring
- To monitor EC2 instances with CloudWatch effectively, always install the CloudWatch Agent manually and assign an IAM role, not a user, to securely give permission to push metrics to CloudWatch.

### 3. Use CPUUtilization for Monitoring EC2 Processing Needs
- The CPUUtilization metric shows how much of your EC2 instance’s brain (CPU) is being used at a given time.
- To monitor how much CPU processing power your application uses on EC2, rely on the CPUUtilization metric. - It provides real-time usage stats that help with capacity planning, scaling decisions, and performance troubleshooting.
- You can use the CPUUtilization metric to see if your EC2 instance is working too hard or not being used enough—if it's always high (like above 80%), it means you may need a bigger instance or more instances (scale up or out), and if it's always low (like below 20%), you might be wasting money and can use a smaller one (scale down).

### 4. CloudWatch Agent Config Overwrites When Reapplied
- When using the CloudWatch Agent, if you run the append-config command or reference a second configuration file with the same name, the agent does not merge or append the new data. Instead, it overwrites the current configuration with the contents of the second file. This means any metrics, logs, or settings defined in the first file will be lost unless explicitly repeated in the second file.

### 5. Use StatsD Protocol on Windows for Custom Metrics
- When working with the unified CloudWatch agent on Windows EC2 instances, use the StatsD protocol to collect custom application metrics. It’s the only supported option for non-standard metric collection on Windows.

### 6. EC2 Scheduled Events Are AWS-Initiated
- You cannot create or configure EC2 scheduled events yourself—AWS does this automatically to manage infrastructure. Your responsibility is to monitor for them and take appropriate action (e.g., using EventBridge to notify or automate a response).
- You are allowed to stop, start, or terminate your EC2 instances at any time, and you can even schedule these actions using tools like EventBridge, Lambda, or Systems Manager. However, when AWS talks about "EC2 scheduled events," they mean events that are initiated by AWS (not by you) for things like hardware maintenance or instance migration. 
- These AWS-scheduled events happen automatically, and you cannot create or control them — your role is to monitor for them and respond appropriately. So while you can schedule actions on your instance, you cannot create the AWS maintenance events referred to as “EC2 scheduled events.

### 7. Use Resource-Based Policies for Lambda Targets
- When configuring AWS Lambda as a target in EventBridge, always ensure the Lambda function’s resource policy allows EventBridge to invoke it, rather than relying on IAM roles.
- In aws, If Service A is calling Service B, and Service B supports resource-based policies (like Lambda, S3, API Gateway, or SQS), then Service B just needs a resource policy that says, “Service A is allowed to call me.” No IAM role is needed by Service A.

### 8. Tune CloudWatch Alarms for Better Auto Scaling in Beanstalk
- Elastic Beanstalk scales using CloudWatch alarms attached to your Auto Scaling group. To ensure reliable scaling, you must review and adjust the alarm thresholds so they reflect real-world traffic behavior and system load.
- Elastic Beanstalk automatically creates two default CloudWatch alarms (like CPU usage thresholds) for the Auto Scaling group in your environment. These alarms are what trigger the scaling in and out actions. If Beanstalk isn’t scaling as expected, it likely means the default alarms are not tuned properly for your app’s traffic patterns. You need to adjust the alarm thresholds (e.g., CPU > 70%) to better match your actual workload.

### 9. CloudWatch Alarms Auto-Evaluate, Not Auto-Reset
- If a CloudWatch alarm stays in ALARM state, it’s because the monitored value still violates the threshold. Fix the metric or update the threshold — you don’t need to manually reset or recreate the alarm.
- CloudWatch alarms constantly check the monitored metric (like CPU usage) against the threshold you set. If the value keeps crossing that threshold, the alarm will stay in the ALARM state — even after an action is triggered. The alarm resets only when the metric goes back below the threshold. So, to fix it, adjust the threshold or investigate the metric itself to bring it back to normal levels.

### 10. Use `StatusCheckFailed` for Full EC2 Health Monitoring
- This metric alerts you when either the system or instance health check fails, making it the most complete and effective choice for EC2 alarm configurations.
- The StatusCheckFailed metric is the best choice because it covers both instance status checks and system status checks. That means it triggers if either check fails.

### 11. Personal Health Dashboard for Resource-Level Impact
- The AWS Personal Health Dashboard (PHD) gives you account-specific insights into AWS service issues, such as outages or high error rates (like DynamoDB request rejections). It shows how these issues affect your actual resources, unlike general dashboards.
- So, when your CTO wants to know exactly which of your resources are impacted by aws service disruptions, the Personal Health Dashboard is the right place to check first. It also offers guidance and recommended steps for mitigation.

### 12. Use a Single CloudWatch Dashboard with Region-Based Graphs
- For efficient global monitoring, create one CloudWatch dashboard and add graphs per region using the AWS Console’s region selector to visualize region-specific metrics easily.

### 13. Use Athena with CloudFront Logs to Debug Frontend Errors
- To troubleshoot CloudFront-related issues like 501 errors, enable CloudFront access logs and store them in an S3 bucket and analyze the logs using Amazon Athena for fast, detailed insights.
- A **501 error** means the server does **not support the functionality** required to fulfill the request—typically indicating that the HTTP method used is **not implemented**.

### 14. Use CloudTrail with Athena to Analyze AWS User Activity
- To identify your most active AWS users, enable CloudTrail to log user actions and use Athena to query those logs—providing detailed insights into who interacts with AWS services the most.

### 15. Combine Read Replicas and Caching for RDS Scalability
- To handle high read demand on popular database items, use Read Replicas for horizontal scaling and ElastiCache for fast, repeated access to hot data—together, they optimize both performance and cost.
- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a fully managed service by AWS that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server in the cloud—without managing the underlying infrastructure.

### 16. Use ALB Access Logs for Deep Request-Level Insights
- To analyze incoming requests for latency and client IP address patterns, ALB (Application Load Balancer) access logs are the best option. These logs capture detailed information about every request sent to your load balancer, including:
    - Client IP address
    - Request processing time (latency)
    - Backend target response time
    - Requested URL and response codes

### 17. Use AWS CloudTrail for API Call Auditing
- Whenever you need to track actions made on AWS resources via the console or APIs, enable CloudTrail. It provides complete governance and compliance tracking for your AWS environment.

### 18. Use Enhanced Monitoring for OS-Level Metrics in RDS
- **Enhanced Monitoring** shows you **live, detailed system info** for your RDS database, like how much **CPU, memory, disk, or network** it’s using. It checks more often than normal monitoring, so you can see **problems faster**. It’s helpful when you want to watch how the **server behind the database** is doing, not just the database itself.

### 19. Enable Logging for Aurora Serverless MySQL to Audit Activity
- To track what’s happening in your Aurora Serverless (MySQL) database and send the logs to CloudWatch, you need to turn on logging yourself by enabling slow query logs, general logs, and audit logs in the DB cluster's parameter group. Once enabled, the logs can go to CloudWatch so you can monitor and review database activity in one place.

### 20. Use Queue Name Dimension for SQS Auto Scaling Metrics
- Amazon SQS automatically sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch using the queue name as the main dimension. When configuring auto scaling based on SQS metrics (e.g., ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible), you must reference the queue name in the metric filter to properly scale resources based on queue depth or traffic.

### 21. Use CloudTrail for API Call Auditing
When tracking **who is making sensitive API calls**, especially for compliance or security audits, CloudTrail is the right tool. It records API usage across AWS services, including **identity**, **timestamp**, **source IP**, and **request parameters**.

### 22. Organization Trails for Centralized Logging
- When setting up an organization trail in AWS Organizations, it allows centralized logging of events from all accounts in the org. Member accounts can view the trail but cannot make changes, helping enforce consistent security and compliance.
- CloudTrail by default tracks only management-level (bucket-level) events. If you want detailed object-level activity (e.g. uploads/downloads), you must explicitly enable S3 data events, which can generate a large number of logs and incur additional costs.
### 23. CloudTrail Log File Integrity for Compliance
- Enable CloudTrail log file validation to verify that your logs are tamper-proof and haven’t been altered. This is essential for security audits and meeting compliance standards like PCI DSS and HIPAA. It gives you confidence that your audit trail is complete and trustworthy.
### 24. CloudTrail Centralized Logging for Multi-Region Accounts
- When you enable CloudTrail across regions, it collects API activity from all regions and delivers them to one centralized S3 bucket, enabling unified logging and auditing.
### 25. IT Portfolios
- An IT portfolio is a collection of approved cloud resources, applications, and configurations (like EC2 instances, RDS databases, or full environments) that your organization wants teams to use. It acts like a menu of pre-approved cloud setups to ensure security, cost control, and standardization.
### 26. AWS Service Catalog Sharing
- Service Catalog sharing lets you share these IT portfolios with other AWS accounts or all accounts in an AWS Organization. This means teams in different accounts can launch predefined, approved resources without needing to build them from scratch, keeping everything consistent and centrally managed.
### 27. AuroraReplicaLagMaximum for Cluster-Wide Lag Reports
- The AuroraReplicaLagMaximum metric shows the longest replication delay across all Aurora replicas in a cluster. It helps you spot replication bottlenecks, which is critical for latency-sensitive apps and to ensure high availability setups meet their performance SLAs.
### 28. Digest Files
- In CloudTrail, digest files are like proof files. They hold special codes (hashes) for each log to show if the logs are still original or have been changed. AWS makes them automatically when you enable log validation.
### 29. CloudTrail Digest Encryption Behavior
- CloudTrail log files can be encrypted with SSE-KMS for stronger security, but digest files (used for integrity checks) are always encrypted with SSE-S3. This design keeps digest files secure while avoiding extra KMS decryption steps, making integrity verification faster and simpler.
### 30. AWS Config Triggers for Continuous Compliance
- When monitoring critical configurations (like CloudTrail), use both configuration and periodic triggers to ensure real-time and scheduled compliance checks across AWS resources.
- Use configuration triggers for real-time compliance checks whenever a resource changes
- Use periodic triggers for scheduled checks to catch anything missed. Together, they help you monitor critical settings (like CloudTrail) and ensure your AWS environment stays continuously compliant.
- You dont have to create two seperate config rules as one rule can handle both triggers efficiently.
### 31. S3 Object Ownership and ACLs
- When sending files to an S3 bucket in another AWS account, the uploader owns the objects by default unless configured otherwise. To fix this, use PutObjectAcl to grant the bucket owner full control or enable S3 Object Ownership (Bucket owner enforced) so the bucket owner automatically gets ownership of all uploaded files. This prevents access issues and simplifies cross-account data sharing.
- Adding the PutObjectAcl permission ensures that the exported objects’ ownership and ACLs are updated so Account B users can fully control them.
### 32. AWS Health API for Custom Integration 
- The AWS Health API lets you pull real-time AWS health alerts and events into your own tools or dashboards. This helps you detect issues proactively and integrate AWS status updates with your existing management systems for faster response.
- This means the apps, systems, or dashboards your team already uses to monitor and manage your environment — like Slack, ServiceNow, Grafana, Datadog, or a custom web app.
- With the AWS Health API, you can send AWS health events (like EC2 outages, RDS maintenance, etc.) directly into those tools so your team can see issues in one place, get alerts, and take action quickly.
- Instead of logging into the AWS console, you could see AWS service events in your existing monitoring dashboard or get automatic tickets in your IT management system.
- AWS Personal Health Dashboard is interactive for humans, not designed for integration with custom tools.
- Service Health Dashboard shows general service health, but doesn’t give account-specific operational impact or APIs for integration.
### 33. AWS OpsHub for Snowball Management
- If you want to manage AWS Snow Family devices with a simple interface instead of CLI, use AWS OpsHub. It simplifies operations like unlocking devices and transferring data locally or to the cloud.
### 34. AWS Config Notification Behavior
AWS Config only sends compliance notifications when a resource’s compliance state changes (e.g., compliant to non-compliant). If a periodic evaluation finds the resource still in the same state, no new notification is sent.
- If the resource remains non-compliant during subsequent evaluations, no new notifications are triggered because there is no state change.
