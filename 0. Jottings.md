## Jottings

### 1. EC2 standard networking

- EC2 standard networking is the default network setup for EC2 instances, offering basic connectivity with moderate speed and higher latency compared to Enhanced Networking.

### 2. EC2 Enhanced Networking

- EC2 Enhanced Networking is a feature in AWS that makes your virtual server (EC2 instance) communicate faster and more efficiently over the network. It reduces delays, increases speed, and handles more data at once, making it great for applications that need high performance, such as big data processing or gaming servers.
- EC2 Enhanced Networking supports Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) and the legacy Intel 82599 VF (up to 10 Gbps).

### 3. Elastic Network Adapter

- Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) is a special network card for AWS EC2 instances that allows them to send and receive data faster (up to 100 Gbps) with lower delays. It helps applications that need high-speed networking, like video streaming, gaming, and big data processing.

### 4. Intel 82599 Virtual Function

- Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) is an older network adapter option for AWS EC2 instances that allows data transfer up to 10 Gbps. It provides better performance than standard networking but is considered legacy compared to the faster ENA (Elastic Network Adapter).

### 5. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)

- Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a special version of Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) that makes Linux EC2 instances communicate even faster, especially for supercomputing and machine learning. While ENA boosts network speed, EFA takes it further by reducing delays and helping servers work together more smoothly.
- Enhanced Networking and EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter) are separate features.
- Enhanced Networking (ENA or Intel 82599 VF) improves general network speed and performance.
- EFA is built on ENA but adds extra features for supercomputing, machine learning, and HPC workloads by reducing delays and improving communication between servers.

### 6. EC2 Placement Groups

- EC2 Placement Groups are like choosing where to sit in a restaurant—whether you want to be close to friends (for fast talking), spread out (for safety), or in a balanced spot (for a mix of both).
- EC2 Placement Groups are a way to organize your EC2 instances to control how they are placed on AWS servers, helping improve speed, reduce delays, or increase reliability.

### 7. Cluster Placement Group

- Groups instances close together within a single Availability Zone for low-latency, high-speed networking.

### 8. Spread Placement Group

- In a Spread Placement Group, each instance is placed on a separate hardware (rack). These racks can be in the same or different AZs. You can have a spread group that is limited to one AZ, but if spread across multiple AZs, it allows up to 7 instances per AZ.
  -If you launch 10 instances in a Spread Placement Group across 3 AZs, AWS might place: - 4 instances in AZ-1 (each on a separate rack) - 3 instances in AZ-2 (each on a separate rack) - 3 instances in AZ-3 (each on a separate rack)

### 9. What is a Partition?

- A partition is a group of hardwares (racks) not necessarily working together as teammates or collaborating to process workloads, but serving instances within that partition. They are isolated from other partitions to prevent failures from spreading.
- They exist within a single Availability Zone. You can have multiple partitions within the same AZ.

### 10. Partition Placement Groups

- Spreads instances across separate racks (partitions) within an Availability Zone, scaling up to hundreds of instances for big data applications (e.g., Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka).
- If you create a Partition Placement Group in AZ-1 with 3 partitions, AWS might distribute instances like this:
  - Partition 1: Uses Rack A, Rack B, Rack C
  - Partition 2: Uses Rack D, Rack E, Rack F
  - Partition 3: Uses Rack G, Rack H, Rack I

### 11. Placement groups limitations

- Cluster Placement Group → No fixed limit, but all instances must be in the same AZ. Optimized for low-latency, high-speed networking. AWS recommends using homogeneous instance types for best performance.
- Spread Placement Group → Limited to 7 instances per Availability Zone. If using multiple AZs, you can have 7 instances per AZ (e.g., 21 instances if spread across 3 AZs). Each instance is placed on a separate rack for maximum fault tolerance.
- Partition Placement Group → No strict instance limit (can scale to hundreds of instances). You can have up to 7 partitions per AZ (default limit, but can be increased). Each partition can hold many instances (AWS distributes them across racks inside that partition).

### 12. Termination Protection

- Even with Termination Protection enabled, an instance will still terminate if shut down from within the OS(i.e sudo shutdown) if its Shutdown Behavior is set to "Terminate", but Termination Protection prevents deletion from the AWS Console, CLI, or API.
- Running sudo shutdown inside an EC2 instance will stop or terminate the instance based on its Shutdown Behavior setting:
  - If Shutdown Behavior = "Stop" → The instance stops (can be restarted later).
  - If Shutdown Behavior = "Terminate" → The instance terminates (permanently deleted).

### 13. What is a vCPU?

- A vCPU (virtual Central Processing Unit) is a logical CPU assigned to an EC2 instance. It represents a portion of a physical CPU's computing power and is used to process tasks within an instance. The number of vCPUs an instance has depends on its instance type (e.g., t3.micro has 2 vCPUs, while c5.24xlarge has 96 vCPUs).
- Launching the instance in a different region helps because vCPU limits are set per region, meaning the limit you reached applies only to the current region. If you switch to another region where you haven't hit the limit, you can launch the instance there without needing an immediate limit increase. However, this may introduce latency issues if your workload requires low-latency connections between regions.

### 14. What Makes vCPU Usage Increase?

- Launching More Instances → Each instance type has a fixed number of vCPUs, so more instances = more vCPUs used.
- Using Larger Instance Types → Bigger instances (e.g., m5.8xlarge) have more vCPUs than smaller ones (e.g., m5.large).
- Increasing Auto Scaling → If an Auto Scaling Group adds instances, the total vCPU count increases.
- Running On-Demand or Spot Instances → AWS tracks only running instances for vCPU limits (stopped instances don't count).

### 15. InstanceLimitExceeded error(your fault)

- The #InstanceLimitExceeded error occurs when you exceed the maximum allowed vCPUs for running instances in a region, which is based on AWS's vCPU-based limits for On-Demand and Spot instances.

### 16. InsufficientInstanceCapacity(aws fault)

- The #InsufficientInstanceCapacity error occurs when AWS lacks enough On-Demand capacity in a specific Availability Zone, and it can be resolved by waiting and retrying, splitting large requests into smaller ones, selecting a different instance type, or launching in another AZ.

### 17. Instance Terminates Immediately

- The Instance Terminates Immediately issue occurs when an EC2 instance goes from pending to terminated due to reasons like reaching the EBS volume limit, a corrupt EBS snapshot, missing permissions for an encrypted root EBS volume, or a store-backed AMI missing required files
- The exact cause can be found in the EC2 Console → Instances → Description tab → State transition reason label.

### 18 Private Key Permissions

- 400 permissions on a .pem file mean that only the file owner can read it, preventing unauthorized access and avoiding the "Unprotected private key file" SSH error.
- Ensure the .pem file has 400 permissions to avoid the "Unprotected private key file" error.

### 19. Corrrect OS username

- Using the correct OS username (e.g., ec2-user for Amazon Linux, ubuntu for Ubuntu) is essential for successful SSH login and to avoid errors like "Host key not found", "Permission denied", or "Connection closed by [instance] port 22"

### 20. Connection timed out Error

- A "Connection timed out" error when connecting to an EC2 instance via SSH can be caused by misconfigured Security Groups (SG) or NACLs, incorrect subnet route tables, missing public IPv4, or high CPU load on the instance.

### 21. SSH vs Instance Connect

- With SSH, you can only connect to an EC2 instance if your IP address is allowed in the Security Group, blocking others. EC2 Instance Connect lets you connect without changing security rules by temporarily adding a public key for access.
- Temporarily adding a public key means that EC2 Instance Connect pushes an SSH key to the EC2 instance for a short time (usually 60 seconds), allowing you to connect without permanently storing keys or modifying security rules.

### 22. EC2 Instance Connect

- EC2 Instance Connect works by temporarily pushing an SSH key to the instance using AWS's special IP range, which does not require the instance itself to have an IP from that range.
- However, for Instance Connect to succeed, the Security Group must allow inbound SSH (port 22) from AWS's special IP range. By default, new instances usually work with Instance Connect because they inherit a Security Group that permits SSH from 0.0.0.0/0, which includes AWS's IP range.
- If you modify the inbound rules to allow only your local PC's IP, Instance Connect will fail since AWS's special IP range is blocked.
- To keep both direct SSH and Instance Connect functional, you should allow SSH from both your local IP and AWS's special IP range in the Security Group.

### 23. Instance Price Predictability

- On-Demand Instances have fixed per-second or per-hour pricing, so you always know the cost upfront without long-term commitments(Reserved) or price changes(Spot).
- Reserved Instances pricing can be unpredictable if you commit to a term but later need different instance types, regions, or fewer instances, as the upfront payment is non-refundable and locked in.
- Spot Instances pricing is unpredictable because it changes based on supply and demand, meaning the cost can go up or down at any time, and AWS can terminate the instance if the price exceeds your bid.

### 24. Instances Usage

- Recommended for short term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave.
- You can buy and sell Reserved Instances in Reserved Instance Marketplace if you dont need them anymore.
- Convertible Reserved Instances offer up to 66% discount and allow flexibility to change the EC2 instance type, family, OS, scope, and tenancy during the reservation period.

### 25. EC2 Spot Instances

- EC2 Spot Instances offer up to 90% cost savings compared to On-Demand but can be interrupted anytime if the Spot price exceeds your bid, making them ideal for batch jobs, data analysis, image processing, and flexible workloads, but not suitable for critical jobs or databases.

### 26. EC2 Dedicated Hosts

- EC2 Dedicated Hosts provide a fully dedicated physical server for your use, supporting BYOL (Bring Your Own License) and compliance requirements, but are the most expensive option, available On-Demand or Reserved (1 or 3 years).
- BYOL (Bring Your Own License) allows you to use your existing software licenses on AWS infrastructure.

### 27. Dedicated Instances Vs Dedicated Hosts

- Dedicated Instances → AWS reserves a physical server for your account, but AWS decides instance placement, and instances may move if stopped/started.
- Dedicated Hosts → AWS reserves a physical server for your account, but YOU control where instances are placed, ensuring they stay on the same host.
- This makes Dedicated Hosts ideal for BYOL (Bring Your Own License) scenarios, compliance needs, and workloads requiring manual instance placement.

### 28. EC2 Capacity Reservations

- EC2 Capacity Reservations guarantee On-Demand instance capacity in a specific Availability Zone (AZ) for any duration, with no time commitment or discounts, and you pay the On-Demand rate even if instances are not running, making them ideal for short-term, uninterrupted workloads needing capacity assurance.

### 29. EC2 Savings Plans

- EC2 Savings Plans give you big discounts (up to 72%) if you commit to spending a fixed amount per hour ($/hour) for 1 or 3 years, allowing flexibility in instance size, OS, and tenancy, but they are limited to a specific instance family and AWS region.
- If you always use EC2 and want discounts without being locked into specific instances, Savings Plans are a great choice
- EC2 Savings Plans give discounts based on a spending commitment ($/hour) but do not guarantee capacity—you save money but still depend on available EC2 instances.
- EC2 Capacity Reservations guarantee instance availability in a specific AZ but do not provide discounts—you pay On-Demand rates even if the instances are not running.

### 30. EC2 IPv4 750-hour free tier

- Starting February 1, 2024, AWS charges $0.005 per hour (~$3.6/month) for each Public IPv4, with a 750-hour free tier for new EC2 instances in the first 12 months, but no free tier for Load Balancers or RDS.

### 31. Cancelling a Spot Request

- To terminate Spot Instances, you must first cancel the Spot Request (if it is open, active, or disabled) and then manually terminate the running Spot Instances, as cancelling a Spot Request alone does not terminate the instances.

### 32. pot Fleet

- A Spot Fleet is a group of Spot Instances (and optional On-Demand Instances) that automatically finds the best-priced instances based on your settings, using different strategies to balance cost, availability, and performance.
- A Spot Fleet selects the best instance type and Availability Zone from multiple launch pools (e.g., m5.large in us-east-1a, m5.xlarge in us-east-1b, c5.large in us-east-1c) based on price and availability to maintain capacity at the lowest cost.

### 33. Launch pools

- Launch pools in a Spot Fleet are the different instance types, operating systems, and Availability Zones that the fleet can choose from when launching instances.
- A Spot Fleet checks all the launch pools and picks the best option based on your price and capacity preferences.
- If one pool becomes too expensive or unavailable, the fleet switches to another pool to maintain the requested capacity.
- This helps reduce costs while ensuring that enough instances are running for your workload.

### 34. Spot Request

- A Spot Request asks for a single Spot Instance, while a Spot Fleet requests and manages multiple Spot Instances across different instance types, AZs, and pricing strategies to optimize cost and availability.

### 35. EC2 burst balances

Think of EC2 burst balances as a savings account for CPU power. Your instance saves unused CPU capacity to spend later when it needs a performance boost.
EC2 burst balances represent the extra processing power your instance has stored up for short, high-performance tasks. They are like a "reserve energy tank" for your EC2 instance's CPU, allowing it to handle more work temporarily when needed.

### 36. Deployment Strategies

Immutable Updates: Deploys new instances in a separate group and switches traffic to them once they're ready. Old instances are terminated, leading to burst credit loss.
Traffic Splitting: Routes a percentage of traffic to newly created instances while gradually reducing traffic to the old ones. Once fully switched over, the old instances are terminated.
If you want to preserve EC2 burst balances during deployments, opt for in-place deployment strategies like Rolling or All-at-once, as they update existing instances without replacing them.

### 37. Understanding EC2 Burst Balance Loss During Deployments

If you notice EC2 burst balances are lost after a deployment, it is likely due to using immutable updates or traffic splitting mode, as these deployment strategies replace existing instances with new ones. To preserve burst balances, use in-place deployment strategies such as Rolling or All-at-once, which update existing instances instead of replacing them.

### 38. Burstable Instances

- Burstable Instances (T2/T3) run at normal CPU power but can boost performance ("burst") when needed using credits—if credits run out, the CPU slows down until new credits build up.
- T2/T3 instances are burstable EC2 instances that provide basic CPU performance but can temporarily boost ("burst") when needed using CPU credits, which accumulate when the instance is idle and deplete when high CPU power is used.
- As of now, T2, T3, T3a, and T4g are the only burstable instance types in AWS. These instances use CPU credits to provide temporary bursts of high performance when needed
- The Unlimited Mode for T2, T3, T3a, and T4g instances allows them to burst beyond their CPU credit limit without performance drops, but with additional charges if CPU usage stays high for too long.

### 39. Elastic IP

- An Elastic IP is a fixed public IPv4 address for an EC2 instance, which remains the same even if the instance stops and starts, can be remapped to another instance, and is free when attached but incurs charges when unused.

### 40. CloudWatch Metrics

- CloudWatch Metrics for EC2 include Basic Monitoring (free, 5-minute intervals) and Detailed Monitoring (paid, 1-minute intervals), tracking CPU, network, disk, and status checks.
- EC2 CloudWatch metrics include CPU usage, network traffic, status checks, and disk read/write, but do not track RAM usage, requiring custom metrics for memory monitoring.

### 41. EC2 CloudWatch metrics

- CPU Usage – Measures CPU utilization and burstable instance credit balance to track processing power.
- Network Traffic – Monitors incoming and outgoing network data to analyze bandwidth usage.
- Status Checks – Checks instance health, system hardware, and attached EBS volume status to detect issues.
- Disk Read/Write – Tracks read and write operations (Ops/Bytes) for instance store disks, but not for EBS volumes.

### 42. Custom CloudWatch metrics

- Custom CloudWatch metrics allow users to push their own data (e.g., RAM and application-level metrics) at 1-minute (basic) or 1-second (high) resolution, but require proper IAM permissions on the EC2 instance role.

### 43. Unified CloudWatch Agent

- By default, EC2 instances do not send logs to CloudWatch Logs, and you need the Unified CloudWatch Agent to collect and push system logs, as well as metrics like RAM and disk usage, which are not included in standard EC2 monitoring.
- It requires correct IAM permissions, supports centralized configuration via SSM Parameter Store, and uses CWAgent as the default namespace for collected metrics.
- The Unified CloudWatch Agent uses SSM Parameter Store to store and manage its settings in one place, so you can easily update and apply the same configuration to multiple instances.

### 44. Procstat plugin
- The procstat plugin in the Unified CloudWatch Agent monitors CPU, memory, and system utilization of individual processes on Linux and Windows. , and reports metrics with the "procstat" prefix (e.g., procstat_cpu_usage).
- Without the procstat plugin, you wouldn’t get process-level insights, making it harder to diagnose issues in complex applications.

### 45. Process-level insights
- Process-level insights provide detailed data on individual processes, including CPU and memory usage, uptime, resource spikes, and health status, helping identify and troubleshoot performance issues.
- EC2 standard monitoring in CloudWatch does not monitor process-level insights; it only tracks overall system metrics like CPU, disk, network, and instance status, but does not show which individual processes are using resources
